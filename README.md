FruitGuard Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Introduction

FruitGuard is an innovative application designed to help users classify fruits as fresh or spoiled. This application leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze fruit characteristics and determine their condition. Key features of FruitGuard include image-based fruit condition detection, real-time classification into "Fresh" or "Spoiled" categories, and an intuitive user interface for effortless operation.
