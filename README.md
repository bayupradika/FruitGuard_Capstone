## Features 💡

Using Mammates fruits Classification, you can categorize fruits images into 2 classes.

| Class | Label        |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 0     | Fresh_Fruits  |
| 1     | Rotten_Fruits |

## Prerequisites 📋

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 2.14.0 or higher
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 24.0.7 or higher

## Usage ✨

If you already have Docker installed, you only need to run the following command:

- Pull the image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull putuwaw/mammates-food-classification
```

- Run the image:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 --name ml-clf putuwaw/mammates-food-classification
```

- You can check that the model is already running by opening the browser and go to http://localhost:8501/v1/models/food_clf

- To do prediction, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MamMates/ml-food-classification/main/example.json | curl -X POST -d @- http://localhost:8501/v1/models/food_clf:predict
```

- You will get the following response:

```json
{
  "predictions": [
    [
      6.28405522e-11, 7.40732e-6, 0.998946607, 1.49191326e-8, 0.000139753625,
      2.86315444e-5, 0.000863699941, 6.22894277e-7, 1.15933371e-5, 1.64414064e-6
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Development 💻

If you want to develop this model, you can follow the steps below:

- Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MamMates/ml-food-classification.git
```

- Update the model by changing the saved model in the [model](model/) folder.

- Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t mammates-food-classification .
```

- Run the image:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 --name ml-clf mammates-food-classification
```

- You can check that the model is already running by opening browser and go to http://localhost:8501/v1/models/food_clf

- To do prediction, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -d @example.json -X POST http://localhost:8501/v1/models/food_clf:predict
```

- To stop the container:

```bash
docker stop ml-clf
```
